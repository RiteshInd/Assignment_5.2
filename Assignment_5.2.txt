1. Calculate the P Value for the test in Problem 2.

2. How do you test the proportions and compare against hypothetical props? Test Hypothesis: proportion of automatic cars is 40%.


The p-value for this test is the probability of obtaining a z-score equal to observed test statistic (which had z-score = -1.680919) or more extreme, which in this problem statement is less than the observed test statistic. In other words, we want to know the area under a standard normal curve on the interval (-8, -1.680919]. We can get this easily with 

pnorm(-1.680919)
